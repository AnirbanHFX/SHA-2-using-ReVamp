# SHA-2-using-ReVamp
### ins_gen.c
This program is used to generate the entire instruction set for implementing SHA-2 512 on ReVamp.
It also generates the PIR inputs.
The words at each round (Wi) have been initialized to 0 for simplicity, since this does not effect the algorithm.
### SHA-2.ins
The instruction set that implements the SHA-2 512 cryptographic hash algorithm using a ReVamp architecture.
Generated by ins_gen.c
### SHA-2.inp
The PIR inputs.
Generated automatically by ins_gen.c
### config_data.json
Specifies which files are used for instructions and PIR inputs.
### revamp.py
ReRam crossbar simulator
### sha2ref.c
Reference program used to test the instruction set and PIR inputs.
Prints final SHA-2 states in inverted form since the crossbar stores states in inverted form.
For simplicity the words at each round (Wi) have been initialized to 0.
